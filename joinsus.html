        <h2>How to Join?</h2>
        <p>Why is it important to join? Because you will be contributing to aid, protection, and helping those in need through various initiatives and efforts. Your support can make a difference.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Join a Legacy</h2>
        <p>Check if there is an ADI chapter near you. If there is, get in contact with them. If not, email us to inquire about starting or joining a chapter in your area.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Do I Have to Pay for My Own Airfares and Bus Tickets?</h2>
        <p>Yes, but it also depends on the mission. In most cases, you must fund your own transportation. However, uniforms and three meals a day will be provided during the mission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Can I Apply for Specific Dates?</h2>
        <p>No, when a position becomes available, we search for members available during that period. The larger your window of availability, the more likely an opportunity will come up in that time frame. When we have a suitable space available, you may be contacted for an interview.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Where Are the Missions Located?</h2>
        <p>Our missions are not set in one place, but they are mostly located around the Philippines. We aim to serve diverse areas and address the needs of different communities.</p>
